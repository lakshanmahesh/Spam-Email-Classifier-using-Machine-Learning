# Spam-Email-Classifier-using-Machine-Learning
This project is a Spam Email Detection System built using Python and Scikit-learn.   It classifies incoming emails as either Spam or Ham (Non-Spam) using a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Logistic Regression model.   The model was trained on a labeled SMS/email dataset and deployed through a simple web interface for real-time predictions.
